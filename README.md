# Overview
This is the web application that displays the read only data computed by the primary midas project. 
For information on the logic for how the data displayed in this application is generated visit the /midas project.
This project loads json files from it's hard drive that are populated via background batch jobs so it does not direct connecting a database but pulls into memory the JSON aggregate of everything it needs to display precomputed by jobs/processes in the /midas project.
